Tired of the old boring e-commerce websites that you most commonly used? Ever wished that there was a platform with a little more <i>"pizzazz"</i> or that touch of <i>"fun"</i>?<br />
Yea, I thought so too!<br />
We plan to spice up your E-commerce shopping experience with fun gamifications and features to ensure you are enjoying your shopping experience!

## Design Process :gem:
Throughout the Design Process, we thought very deeply about our favourite and go-to E-Commerce sites. We listed down what made us so engraved onto them. Following that, we explored the many ideas of what features we would like to see implemented on our favourite sites. Henceforth, we created "NoNego!". 'No Nego' is an abbreviation from a popular phrase used on E-Commerce sitess, 'Nego'. Nego, is a short term for negotaition. Our aim is to have our E-commerce site's services and products so enticing that no user would ever think of negotating! Not even Asians! Hence, sparked the catchy name "NoNego"!

The Design of the website was thought of carefully and planned out onto a wireframe, made using Adobe XD. Throughout the creation of our website, we tried our best to keep to the foundation of the wireframe. Alongside, are some minor tweeks and adjustments we feel can only improve an already amazing website, even more amazing!<br>

We implemented games, a friend-buddy system, avatar creation and so much more onto our website! Despite being a relatively new website, feel free to explore and contact us if you have any
